# Statistical-Genetics

#This file includes R markdown format codings for the BS 858 Statistical Genetics 1 Final Project


#I have obtained separate PLINK text files ( .ped, .map, .pheno, .covar) and .csv files (giving the PET amyloid deposition data, AD status, and
covariate data for the individuals and their siblings in the PLINK text files, as well as the rare variants in the gene that were
identified by the targeted sequencing study). 

Objectives: 

#1) analyze the data to determine whether your samples replicate the results of
#the given research study for association between the 16 SNPs (including APOE-e4) and the amyloid deposition measured.
#2) determine if the rare variants in the gene are significantly associated with the outcome in my sample.
